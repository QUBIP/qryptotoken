## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find any vulnerability in this project,
don't hesitate to _report them_.

1. Use any of the [private contact addresses](https://github.com/qubip/qryoptic#support).
2. Describe the vulnerability.

   If you have a fix, that is most welcome -- please attach or summarize
   it in your message!

3. We will evaluate the vulnerability and, if necessary, release a fix
   or mitigating steps to address it.
   We will contact you to let you know the outcome, and will credit you
   in the report.

   Please **do not disclose the vulnerability publicly** until a fix is
   released!

4. Once we have either
   a) published a fix, or
   b) declined to address the vulnerability for whatever reason,
   you are free to publicly disclose it.
