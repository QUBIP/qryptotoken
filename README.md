## About

`qryptotoken` is a pure-Rust software token implementation of a PKCS#11 loadable module for the Internet Browsing pilot of
[QUBIP](https://www.qubip.eu) project.

The project builds upon and diverges from the original [kryoptic](https://github.com/latchset/kryoptic) project with the primary distinction being the added capability to build the project as a Rust-only version.

The objective of this project is to develop a framework for integrating Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) functionality into the Mozilla Firefox security library called Network Security Services (NSS).

### Supported algorithms

While we do not tightly couple with specific implementation choices,
at the moment we support a limited selection of algorithms
and external implementations through our `Adapters`.

The current supported algorithms are summarized in the following tables.

> [!NOTE]
> Future updates to qryptotoken will expand its support
> for additional PQC algorithms
> and other external implementations.

#### Key Encapsulation Methods

| Algorithm  | Adapter |
| ---------- | ------- |
| ML-KEM 768 | libcrux |

#### Digital Signatures

| Algorithm | Adapter |
| --------- | ------- |
| ML-DSA-65 | libcrux |

## Getting Started

To get started, first build the `qryptotoken` module by following the [build guide](./docs/build-qryptotoken.md). It will walk you through installing the necessary dependencies, setting up the token environment, and initializing the module using the `pkcs11-tool`.

Once you've successfully built and initialized the module, you're ready to test it with Firefox.

You have two options for setting up Firefox:

- You can build Firefox from source by following a detailed [setup guide](./docs/build-firefox-from-source.md), which is ideal if you want full control and debugging capabilities.
- Or you can use a preconfigured Flatpak image, which is quicker to set up and ready for testing. Setup instructions are provided in the dedicated [Flatpak guide](./docs/installing-flatpak-firefox.md).

Pick the option that suits your needs best.

After your Firefox environment is ready, just follow the [testing guide](./docs/test-with-firefox.md). It will show you how to load the module, and run the interoperability and login tests.
